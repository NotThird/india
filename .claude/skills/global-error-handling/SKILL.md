name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with clear messages and graceful degradation. Use this skill when writing, modifying, or reviewing error handling code. When implementing try-catch blocks, error boundaries, exception handling, or error responses. When designing user-facing error messages, implementing retry strategies, handling API failures, or ensuring proper resource cleanup. When working on any code that may throw exceptions or encounter error conditions.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill:

- When implementing try-catch blocks or error boundaries
- When designing user-facing error messages
- When handling API or network failures
- When implementing retry logic with exponential backoff
- When validating preconditions and failing fast
- When choosing between generic and specific exception types
- When setting up centralized error handling (middleware, interceptors)
- When implementing graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- When ensuring proper resource cleanup (finally blocks, dispose patterns)
- When logging errors without exposing sensitive information
- When handling promise rejections and async errors
- When reviewing code for proper error handling coverage
- When working on controller, service, or API layer code

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
