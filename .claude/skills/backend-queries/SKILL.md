# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill:

- When writing raw SQL queries
- When using ORM query methods (find, where, select, include)
- When working on repository or data access layer files
- When implementing query builders or complex query logic
- When optimizing slow database queries
- When adding eager loading to prevent N+1 query problems
- When writing JOIN statements between tables
- When implementing database transactions
- When adding indexes for query optimization
- When implementing query result caching
- When setting query timeouts
- When ensuring parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- When selecting specific columns instead of SELECT *
- When working on files that contain database interaction code

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
