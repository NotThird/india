name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused, maintainable tests that verify core functionality without over-testing. Use this skill when writing, modifying, or reviewing test files. When working on files in test/, tests/, __tests__/, spec/, or similar directories. When writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. When using test frameworks like Jest, Vitest, Mocha, pytest, RSpec, or similar. When deciding what to test, how to structure tests, or when to mock dependencies.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new test files
- When modifying existing test cases
- When working on files in `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, or similar directories
- When working on files ending in `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, `_test.py`, `_spec.rb`, etc.
- When writing unit tests for functions or classes
- When writing integration tests for API endpoints
- When deciding what functionality to test (focus on core user flows)
- When naming test cases descriptively
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When using Jest, Vitest, Mocha, pytest, RSpec, or other test frameworks
- When ensuring tests run quickly (milliseconds, not seconds)
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When reviewing test coverage and test quality
- When deferring edge case testing to dedicated testing phases

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
