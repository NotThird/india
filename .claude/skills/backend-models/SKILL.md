# Backend Models

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new model or entity files
- When modifying existing model definitions
- When working on files in `models/`, `entities/`, `schemas/`, or similar directories
- When defining model attributes and data types
- When setting up model relationships (has_many, belongs_to, one-to-one, many-to-many)
- When adding foreign key references between models
- When implementing model-level validations
- When adding timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to models
- When defining indexes on model fields
- When setting up database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- When configuring cascade behaviors for relationships
- When working with any ORM (ActiveRecord, Sequelize, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, TypeORM)
- When balancing normalization with query performance

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
