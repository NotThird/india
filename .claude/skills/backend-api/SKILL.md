name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following best practices. Use this skill when creating, modifying, or reviewing API routes and endpoints. When working on controller files, route definitions, API handlers, or any file in routes/, controllers/, api/, or endpoints/ directories. When implementing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), defining URL structures, handling query parameters, setting HTTP status codes, implementing pagination, filtering, sorting, or rate limiting. When designing resource-based URLs, API versioning strategies, or nested resource structures.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new API endpoints or routes
- When modifying existing API handlers or controllers
- When working on files in `routes/`, `controllers/`, `api/`, or `endpoints/` directories
- When implementing RESTful HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When designing URL structures and resource naming
- When adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When setting HTTP status codes for API responses
- When implementing API versioning
- When working on rate limiting or API throttling
- When defining nested resource relationships in URLs
- When reviewing API design for consistency and best practices

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
