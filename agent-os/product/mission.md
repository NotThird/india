# Product Mission

## Pitch

**India Trip Hub** is a personal trip planning website that helps a small travel group (2-4 people) organize their India trip for a wedding and cloth shopping by providing a single, shared source of truth for itineraries, bookings, packing lists, and collaborative planning.

## Users

### Primary Users

- **The Couple**: Primary trip planners who will organize itineraries, research destinations, and manage bookings
- **Partner's Parents**: Occasional collaborators who need visibility into plans and ability to add input

### User Personas

**Primary Planner** (25-35)
- **Role:** Trip organizer and decision-maker
- **Context:** Planning a multi-purpose India trip (wedding attendance + cloth shopping)
- **Pain Points:** Trip details scattered across emails, messages, and notes; difficulty keeping partner informed of changes
- **Goals:** Have everything in one place; share plans effortlessly; ensure nothing is forgotten

**Travel Companion** (25-65)
- **Role:** Co-traveler who needs visibility and input capability
- **Context:** Participating in trip planning and execution
- **Pain Points:** Not knowing the latest itinerary; unable to easily suggest changes or additions
- **Goals:** Stay informed; contribute ideas and feedback; access booking details when needed

## The Problem

### Fragmented Trip Information

Trip planning for India involves multiple moving parts: flight bookings, hotel reservations, wedding schedule, shopping locations, packing requirements, and local logistics. This information typically lives in scattered emails, text messages, notes apps, and browser bookmarks. When traveling with others, keeping everyone aligned becomes a coordination burden.

**Our Solution:** A single web destination that consolidates all trip information with collaborative features, accessible to the entire travel group from any device.

## Differentiators

### Personal and Purpose-Built

Unlike generic travel apps (TripIt, Google Trips) that try to serve everyone, this is a custom solution built specifically for this trip's unique needs: wedding attendance, cloth shopping, and small-group coordination. No bloat, no account requirements for viewers, no feature limitations.

### Lightweight and Accessible

Static hosting on Netlify means the site loads instantly, works offline after first visit, and costs nothing to run. No app downloads required - just share a URL.
